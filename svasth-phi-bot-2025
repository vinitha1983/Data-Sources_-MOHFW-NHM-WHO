  Ministry of Health & FAmily Welfare Ministry of Health and Family Welfare consisted of two departments, each led by a Secretary of the Government of India: 
  the Department of Health and Family Welfare and the Department of Health Research. On August 7, 2014, through an extraordinary gazette notification, 
  the Department of AIDS Control was merged with the Department of Health and Family Welfare and is now known as the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO).
  The two departments of the Ministry are as follows: Department of Health and Family Welfare- Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has the following two attached Offices : 
 2.1  Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS): It is an attached office of the Department of Health and Family Welfare. 
  DGHS provides technical advice on medical and public health matters and is involved in the implementation of various health services. 
  National Health Authority: It is responsible for the implementation of India's flagship public health insurance/assurance scheme "Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana" 
  and also handles the planning, technical framework, and implementation of the "National Digital Health Mission."

## 1.Phase 1: Model Setup and Ollama Integration
Step 1: Prepare Your Model for Ollama

###In case of a pre-trained model:
Ensuring that model is in a format compatible with Ollama (typically GGUF).
If not, convert model using varied tools such as llama.cpp.

i. Create a Modelfile:
Create a text file named Modelfile in the same directory as per the model weights.
Add the following content (adjust paths accordingly):
FROM ./your_model_file.gguf # replace with your model file.
SYSTEM """
You are Svasth-phi-bot, a helpful and knowledgeable public health information chat bot. 
It's role is to provide accurate and easy-to-understand information on various public health topics.
This will create an easy guide of available government sponsored schemes and programs. 
This will answer questions related to disease prevention, health promotion, vaccination, nutrition, and general wellness.
All cites are trusted sources and in case that the query response is unanswered, then it is suggested consulting a healthcare professional.
"""

### To replace the model gile in gguf format: 
## Replace ./your_model_file.gguf with the correct path to your model weights file.

Create the model in Ollama:
Openterminal and navigate to the directory containing your Modelfile.

Important: Replace ./your_model_file.gguf with the correct relative path to your GGUF model file.
Save and close the file.

### Run the following command:
ollama create svasth-phi-bot -f Modelfile

Explanation:
ollama create: Tells Ollama to create a new model.
svasth-phi-bot: The name you're giving to your model within Ollama.
-f Modelfile: Specifies the path to your Modelfile.
Output: Ollama will process the Modelfile and create the model. You'll see progress messages in the terminal.


Detailed Phase wise description of creating the Model :
Step 1: Integrating the Model in Open Web UI

##1  Set Up GitHub Repository:
1.1  Create a new repository on GitHub.

1.2  Clone the repository to your local machine.
## CopyReplit
https://github.com/vinithaFPM23005/Data-Sources_-MOHFW-NHM-WHO.git

2. Integrating the Svasth PHI Bot model with the backend of  web application.
   setting up an API route that the UI can call to get responses from the chatbot.

3.Connect the Bot:
To import from Flask
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from your_svasth_bot import SvasthBot  # Assume you have a class for the bot

app = Flask(__name__)
bot = SvasthBot()

@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask_bot():
    user_input = request.json.get('question')
    response = bot.get_response(user_input)
    return jsonify({'response': response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

4.Push Changes to GitHub: 
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup of Svasth PHI Bot web UI"
git push origin main

Step 2: Integrating Public Health Websites
## To enhance the capabilities of PHI bot,We integrate various public health websites for real-time information. 

2.1  Choose APIs from Trusted Sources:
    1. Identify available public health APIs (e.g., WHO, MOHFW, NHM etc. ).
    2. Read the API documentation for instructions on how to use them (endpoints, required parameters, and response formats).
    3.Creating a Unified Service: Once all the API details, create functions in the bot that can call these APIs based on user queries.
      Example API call using Python:
     ## import requests
     def get_health_info(query):
    response = requests.get(f'https://api.example.com/search?q={query}')
    return response.json()  # parse the response as needed

2.2 Modify Bot Logic:
    Incorporate conditionals in PHI bot to check which API to call based on the user query.

 ## Step 3: Convert to GGUF Format
    To convert your chatbot model to a GGUF (Generalized Global Unified Format) format, we need the following steps:

2.3  Exporting the Model: If the model is built using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, use the appropriate functions to export your model to a format that you can convert to GGUF, if GGUF supports it.

2.3.1 Convert to GGUF: Using  library or tool that supports the conversion to GGUF, if available. Refer to the official GGUF documentation to know the exact conversion functions.

##  Step 4: Run Your Model Using Prompts in Terminal
    To run your model using commands in a terminal:
   # Assuming you have a script to run your model
     python run_model.py --prompt "What are the preventive measures for diabetes?"

 ### To Run the Web Server:
     python app.py  # This should start the web server

###  To Test the Chatbot:
     curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ask -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"question": "What are the vaccination schedules?"}'
